# Hack Western 7

## Race for a Taste!

Hey! This is the repo that my team used during "Hack Western 7" which was a virutal hackathon occuring from Oct20-Oct22 2020. 

Our project is called "Race for a Taste", with the goal of making deciding where to eat less "mundane" and "stressful". 
Using yelpAPI and HTML5's geolocation, our app pings your current location and compares different restaurants against each other using criteria like overall rating, distance to travel, total number of ratings and price. 

# Usage 
From the terminal, cd into HackWestern7/foodfight and run npm install. Then with another terminal, cd into Hackwestern/server and also run npm install.
With each respective terminal do "npm run start" on the client, and "node index.js" on the server.
